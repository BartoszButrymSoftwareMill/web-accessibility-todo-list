## 🎨 Design Principles

The application follows inclusive design principles:

- **Perceivable**: Information is presented in ways users can perceive
- **Operable**: Interface components are operable by all users
- **Understandable**: Information and operation are understandable
- **Robust**: Content is robust enough to be interpreted by assistive technologies

## 🔧 Development

The codebase is structured for maintainability and accessibility:

- `src/main.ts` - Core application logic with accessibility considerations
- `src/utils.ts` - Utility functions including accessible SVG components
- `src/style.css` - Styling with focus on accessibility and usability
- `index.html` - Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA attributes
